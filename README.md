## In this repository I create a two layer neural network using numpy and train it on the MNIST digit recognizer data set. 


### The goal of this repo is to 

* Derive the equation for each component that creates the neural netowrk,
* Implement these equation to get a better understanding of the math and how neural networks operate under the hood 
* Use this numpy neural network to predict on the MNIST digit data set.
