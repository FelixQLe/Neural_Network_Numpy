### In this repository I create a two layer neural network using numpy and train it on the MNIST digit recognizer data set. 


### The goal of this repo is to:

* Derive the equations for each component of the neural netowrk. (Forward propagation, backward propagation, parameter updates)  
* Implement these equation to get a better understanding of the math and how neural networks operate under the hood 
* Use this numpy neural network to predict on the MNIST digit data set. 
* Use this as a starting point to create more complex neural networks using Tensorflow and Pytorch to solve interesting problems, time series forcasting LSTM and computer vision CNN.
